                    <p class="about-content">I don't have a whole lot to put here in the interest of opsec, but
                        I can probably get the minimum across. Also see my resume below. (Outdated, censored, and in png format, also for opsec. I don't trust crawlers
                        or spiders or AIs or what-have-yous; the last thing I want is to have my email filled up with bot requests. (You know,
                        in the future, your refrigerator will be able look you up, find your email, and spam it until
                        your inbox can't receive anymore emails--all on its own. Better watch how you shut that fridge door.) Email me
                        if you would like something up-to-date.) <br>
                        But the gist of it is: From WI (which is the Promised Land), soon-to-be Electrical Engineer in TX; graduated CompE/Physics 2024. please see Good Stuff for some
                        things I find interesting, and Photo Albums for pictures I took or made; 
                        I think uploading those is a better use of my time than rambling about here. <br>
                        Also, that image of me--------------><br> is the one picture I had taken of me in my
                        first semester of college back in 2019, right before COVID hit. I've been running on this
                        one picture ever since.
